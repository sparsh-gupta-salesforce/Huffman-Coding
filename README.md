# Huffman-Coding
An algorithm to compress data.The code accepts a text file and produces unique codes against each character of the file which then can be replaced by the corresponding character. Here, small codes are generated for the most frequent characters while longer codes are generated for the less frequent ones, in order to reduce the size of the file.
